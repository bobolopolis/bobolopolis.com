Title: Bobble

Bobble is a program to implement a dashcam using OpenCV. It's mostly an excuse
for me to learn OpenCV and use some C++. It's far from finished, but someday
I'll have the time to fill out the features. Source code is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/bobolopolis/bobble) under GPLv3+.
